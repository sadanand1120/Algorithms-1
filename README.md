# Algorithms-1
This repo contains all the projects and assignments that I have completed as a part of Algorithms-1 course on Coursera. This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. It covers different elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.

**The solutions have been uploaded for personal academic purposes and can be used as a reference by others (but I strongly recommend trying out the assignments on your own).**

Instructor: [Prof. Kevin Wayne](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~246867) and [Prof. Robert Sedgewick](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~250165)

Offered by: [Princeton University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)

Language: Java

## Assignments
- [Percolation Threshold Estimation (via Monte Carlo Simulation)](https://github.com/sadanand1120/Algorithms-1/tree/master/Percolation%20Threshold%20Estimation%20(via%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation))
  - In this assignment, via Monte Carlo Simulation, estimation of the Percolation Threshold has to be made. This assignment is based on the classic Dynamic Connectivity problem, and uses the Union-Find data structure to find in an efficient way whether two nodes in a graph are connected or not.
  - **The complete details of the assignment problem are given [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php).**
